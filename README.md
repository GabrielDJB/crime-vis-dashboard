# crime-vis-dashboard
Repository for a crime data dashboard implemented in React (frontend) and Python (backend). Project served as my final submission for a graduate InfoViz course @ PUC-Rio. Underlying datasets were curated by ISP-RJ and are available in the website: http://www.ispdados.rj.gov.br/.
